Appendix A

Secondo System

Preliminary System Description

Secondo Store has been operating since 2009, and is run by Dan Summers. Dan has provided the following preliminary information about the system he would like you to build, and is looking forward to meeting your team at the first interview you have organised.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Secondo Store is my retail clothing recycle store located at Clayton Road, Clayton. We specialise in seconds, sample and pre-owned Designer, Vintage and Mainstream clothing, shoes and accessories for ladies.

Over time, we have developed a broad and loyal customer base, with most of our customers being females aged 25-60, who return to our store regularly. We have also developed a strong presence in the local area and undertake a range of advertising and marketing initiatives (such as print advertising, direct SMS communication, Instagram and visual merchandising of our windows) to further build and engage our customer base. We have also established good manual, internal business processes, but feel that the timing is right to automate some of our processes as many of the things we do are very time consuming.

We take stock from individual clients who want to sell their second hand clothing, shoes, etc. and business clients who want to sell out of season stock. We take their stock on consignment for 8 weeks, taking a commission on any sales made. Our stock is all currently managed manually. For the new system, I want to focus on automating all the processes associated with the stock. This includes automating processes such as trying to source stock from clients, marking stock down if it does not sell, returning stock to my clients if it does not get sold in the 8 week period, donating unsold stock to Salvos if my clients do not come to pick up their stock, and paying clients if their stock does sell. I would like the new system to help me manage all these processes, so I know exactly where I am with stock at any given time.
